# tempochores_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

---Folder Structure---
Ignore all folders except for /assets (where we put pictures etc) and /lib (where the actual code lies)

/lib
-/pages -> where all the different pages sit
-/shared -> reoccuring pieces are saved here (ex: a specific button styling used across the app)
-/theme -> the apps theme is defined here
main.dart -> controls the app and routing. If you add a new page you need to add it here

---More to come---
